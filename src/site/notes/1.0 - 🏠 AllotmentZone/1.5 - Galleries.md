>[!QUOTE] Susan Sontag - On Photography
>*Though an event has come to mean, precisely, something worth photographing, it is still ideology*

Photography is my thing. It's what I do. Work gets in the way sometimes but above all, I photograph nature and wildlife so that I can share it with fine people like you. Have a browse below.

>[!WARNING] A recommendation if I may? 
>I've curated these galleries from thousands of photos. Take a moment to ditch the social media habits and really look at the images. Rotate your phone and see them big (even save the image to your gallery and study them there if you like). Above all, please enjoy my images. Much time goes into creating them and I ask that you give them a good chance of conveying their stories.

## Photo Stories

Aside from the galleries above, I also write up some of the stories around the images I make. These photo stories can be found her:
