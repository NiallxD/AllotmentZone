## Welcome To The Allotment

The allotment is a community space where people from all walks of life can take up a plot and grow their own digital garden. The allotment leans heavily on concepts developed by the social media boom while placing emphasis on personal blogs and freedom to express oneself however they see fit. 

How does it work? The allotment in it's current form brings together many digital gardens for you to explore. Here you can find inspirational content, follow along with the stories of people with whom you share a passion, or check in on what your mates have been up to. On the flip side, the allotment is a place for digital gardeners to come together to share their stories with others by taking up a plot in the allotment.

## Road Map

The allotment is still very new, I'm still laying the ground work. Here is a little road map of what I'd like to implement. The project will run in phases as there are some things I cannot do and will need to seek support from actual web developers, if the time comes:

Stuff I can do:

- [x] Set up a website: a place for the allotment to live (will use a digital garden format) 
- [ ] Directory: a directory of digital gardens that visitors can browse
- [ ] Filtering/Searching: a tagging system to make categorising gardens easy
- [ ] New gardens: a place to showcase new gardeners

Stuff I can't do:

- [ ] Profiles: A profile system so users can login and customise their allotment path
- [ ] Favouriting: A method of allowing users to favourite digital gardens
