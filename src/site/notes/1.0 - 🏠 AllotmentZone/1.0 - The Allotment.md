## Welcome To The Allotment

The allotment is a community space where people from all walks of life can take up a plot and grow their own digital garden. The allotment leans heavily on concepts developed by the social media boom while placing emphasis on personal blogs and freedom to express oneself however they see fit. 

How does it work? The allotment in it's current form brings together many digital gardens for you to explore. Here you can find inspirational content, follow along with the stories of people with whom you share a passion, or check in on what your mates have been up to. On the flip side, the allotment is a place for digital gardeners to come together to share their stories with others by taking up a plot in the allotment.

## Digital Gardens
